# Vineyard Textures

This directory contains texture files for the vineyard simulation:

## Required Textures:
- `vineyard_soil.jpg` - Main soil texture for vineyard terrain
- `vineyard_soil_normal.jpg` - Normal map for soil texture
- `grass_texture.jpg` - Texture for grass areas between rows
- `vine_leaves.jpg` - Texture for vine plant leaves
- `wooden_post.jpg` - Texture for vineyard posts
- `concrete.jpg` - Texture for buildings and structures

## Texture Guidelines:
- Use 512x512 or 1024x1024 resolution for best performance
- Ensure textures are tileable for seamless appearance
- Use realistic colors and patterns appropriate for vineyard environment

## Placeholder Notice:
Currently using procedural materials. Replace with actual texture files for enhanced realism.
